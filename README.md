# Database assignment 4

This will be our repo to collaborate on the assignment. Let me know if there are any issues.

# Setup
Run the shell script to setup.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will setup your webserver with my files. You should be able to navigate to 'localhost' in the web browser of your choice to view the page.

Add your php files and test. All new files should go into /var/www/html. Send me a pull request and I will test/integrate with the site.

# TODO:

We could just pass in the queries to the existing 'test.php' script and have this done super fast. This seems boring. We could maybe do free-format user input queries with sanitization or neat HTML pages that allow selecting which tables to edit. We should definitely do the bonus question. It's worth huge points.
